# Data Management

I learned data management skills working in various roles, handling unstructured and structured data. In one role, I worked directly with 50+ schools to standardize the data collection process, write code to read and process unstructured data, as well as run quality control checks. 

This project database contains scripts for various tasks that I encountered often while dealing with messy data. There are scripts for R, SAS, and Python, as I had to use different programs depending on my role.
